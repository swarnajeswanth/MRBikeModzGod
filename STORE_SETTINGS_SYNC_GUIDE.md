# Store Settings Real-Time Synchronization Guide

## üéØ Overview

This guide helps you test the real-time synchronization of store settings to ensure that when a retailer changes store settings, the changes are immediately reflected across all customer instances (different browsers, tabs, or devices).

## üöÄ Quick Test Setup

### 1. Start the Full System

```bash
npm run dev:full
```

This starts both:

- Next.js app on http://localhost:3000
- WebSocket server on ws://localhost:3001

### 2. Test Store Settings Sync

```bash
npm run test-store-settings
```

You should see:

```
üß™ Testing Store Settings Real-Time Sync
‚úÖ Retailer Instance 1 connected
‚úÖ Customer Instance 2 connected
‚úÖ Customer Instance 3 connected
üì§ Retailer Instance 1 broadcasting STORE_SETTINGS_UPDATED...
üì® Customer Instance 2 received: STORE_SETTINGS_UPDATED from retailer-instance-1
üì® Customer Instance 3 received: STORE_SETTINGS_UPDATED from retailer-instance-1
‚úÖ Store settings sync test completed!
```

## üß™ Manual Testing Steps

### Test 1: Multiple Browser Tabs

1. **Open multiple tabs** to http://localhost:3000
2. **Navigate to retailer dashboard** in one tab: `/retailer-dashboard`
3. **Navigate to customer pages** in other tabs (homepage, product pages, etc.)
4. **Change store settings** in the retailer tab
5. **Watch for real-time updates** in customer tabs

### Test 2: Different Browsers

1. **Open Chrome** and navigate to `/retailer-dashboard`
2. **Open Firefox** and navigate to the homepage or product pages
3. **Change store settings** in Chrome (retailer)
4. **Watch for updates** in Firefox (customer)

### Test 3: Feature Toggle Testing

1. **Disable a feature** (e.g., "wishlist") in retailer dashboard
2. **Check customer pages** - wishlist buttons should disappear immediately
3. **Enable the feature** again
4. **Check customer pages** - wishlist buttons should reappear immediately

## üìä Expected Behavior

### ‚úÖ Successful Real-Time Sync

When store settings changes work properly, you should see:

1. **In the retailer instance:**

   - Toast notification: "Feature disabled/enabled"
   - Console log: "Broadcasting store settings update to other instances"
   - Console log: "Broadcasting update: STORE_SETTINGS_UPDATED"

2. **In customer instances:**

   - Toast notification: "Store settings updated from another instance"
   - UI updates immediately without page refresh
   - Features appear/disappear based on new settings

3. **In WebSocket server console:**
   - "Received message: { type: 'STORE_SETTINGS_UPDATED', ... }"
   - "Broadcasted to X other clients"

### ‚ùå Issues to Watch For

1. **No real-time updates:**

   - Check if WebSocket server is running
   - Look for "WebSocket not connected" in console
   - Verify connection status

2. **Settings not saving:**

   - Check browser console for API errors
   - Verify database connection
   - Check for network errors

3. **UI not updating:**
   - Check if StoreSettingsWrapper is properly implemented
   - Verify Redux selectors are working
   - Check for component re-rendering issues

## üîç Debugging Steps

### 1. Check WebSocket Connection

Open browser console and look for:

```
Real-time sync connected
```

If you see:

```
WebSocket connection failed, will attempt fallback
Max WebSocket connection attempts reached, using polling fallback
```

Then the WebSocket server isn't running.

### 2. Check Store Settings API

Test the store settings API:

```bash
curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/store-settings
```

Should return current store settings.

### 3. Check Broadcast Function

In browser console, type:

```javascript
typeof window.broadcastDataUpdate;
```

Should return: `"function"`

### 4. Test Store Settings Update

In browser console:

```javascript
// Test broadcast function
window.broadcastDataUpdate("STORE_SETTINGS_UPDATED");
```

Should log: "Broadcasting update: STORE_SETTINGS_UPDATED"

## üõ†Ô∏è Testing Specific Features

### Test Feature Controls

1. **Disable "Add to Cart":**

   - Go to retailer dashboard ‚Üí Features tab
   - Toggle "Add to Cart" to disabled
   - Check product pages - "Add to Cart" buttons should disappear

2. **Disable "Wishlist":**

   - Toggle "Wishlist" to disabled
   - Check product pages - wishlist buttons should disappear

3. **Disable "Reviews":**

   - Toggle "Reviews" to disabled
   - Check product pages - review sections should disappear

4. **Disable "Price Display":**
   - Toggle "Price Display" to disabled
   - Check product pages - prices should be hidden

### Test Page Access Controls

1. **Disable "Cart" page:**

   - Go to retailer dashboard ‚Üí Page Access tab
   - Toggle "Cart" to disabled
   - Try to access `/cart` - should be restricted

2. **Disable "Wishlist" page:**
   - Toggle "Wishlist" to disabled
   - Try to access wishlist - should be restricted

### Test Customer Experience

1. **Disable "Show Prices":**

   - Go to retailer dashboard ‚Üí Customer Experience tab
   - Toggle "Show Prices" to disabled
   - Check all pages - prices should be hidden

2. **Disable "Show Stock":**
   - Toggle "Show Stock" to disabled
   - Check product pages - stock information should be hidden

## üìà Performance Testing

### Test Multiple Instances

1. **Open 5+ browser tabs** to different pages
2. **Change store settings** in retailer dashboard
3. **Monitor timing** - updates should appear within 1-2 seconds
4. **Check all instances** receive updates

### Test Large Settings Changes

1. **Reset all settings** to defaults
2. **Monitor performance** across instances
3. **Check memory usage** in browser dev tools
4. **Verify all instances** receive updates

### Test Network Issues

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: Store Settings Not Syncing

**Symptoms:**

- Changes only appear after page refresh
- No toast notifications from other instances
- Console shows "WebSocket not connected"

**Solutions:**

1. **Start WebSocket server:**

   ```bash
   npm run websocket
   ```

2. **Check API endpoints:**

   ```bash
   curl -X GET http://localhost:3000/api/store-settings
   ```

3. **Restart everything:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

### Issue: Features Not Updating

**Symptoms:**

- Store settings change but UI doesn't update
- Features remain visible when disabled

**Solutions:**

1. **Check StoreSettingsWrapper implementation:**

   ```tsx
   <StoreSettingsWrapper feature="wishlist">
     <WishlistButton />
   </StoreSettingsWrapper>
   ```

2. **Check Redux selectors:**

   ```tsx
   const isWishlistEnabled = useSelector(selectIsFeatureEnabled("wishlist"));
   ```

3. **Verify component re-rendering:**
   - Check if components are properly subscribed to Redux state
   - Ensure StoreSettingsWrapper is used correctly

### Issue: Settings Not Saving

**Symptoms:**

- Changes revert after page refresh
- Console shows API errors

**Solutions:**

1. **Check database connection:**

   - Verify MongoDB is running
   - Check connection string

2. **Check API responses:**

   - Look for 500 errors in Network tab
   - Check server logs for errors

3. **Test API manually:**
   ```bash
   curl -X PUT http://localhost:3000/api/store-settings \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"features":{"wishlist":false}}'
   ```

## üöÄ Production Considerations

For production deployment:

1. **Use a proper WebSocket service** (Socket.io, Pusher, etc.)
2. **Implement proper authentication** for store settings updates
3. **Add rate limiting** for settings changes
4. **Implement audit logging** for settings changes
5. **Use environment variables** for WebSocket URLs
6. **Add monitoring and analytics** for settings usage

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues:

1. **Check the troubleshooting guide** above
2. **Run the test scripts:**
   ```bash
   npm run test-store-settings
   npm run test-websocket
